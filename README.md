## Introduction

A collection of [Alfred][Alfred] workflows that I have created over the last few years. Many of them are customized for 
use at IBM and will not work outside of the IBM internal network. Make sure to check the notes for each workflow.

## Workflows

IBM Faces 

Faces is a simple workflow that allows IBM employees to easily search the Faces employee database.
