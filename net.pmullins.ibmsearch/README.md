# IBM Search Workflow for Alfred

[IBM](https://twitter.com/IBM) Search is a simple [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for [OS X](https://www.apple.com/osx/) 
that lets employees search for information (people, departments, etc.) using IBM's Bluepages, Connections, w3 Intranet, and Faces services.

Example:
