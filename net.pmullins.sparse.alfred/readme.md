## Sparse Image

Easily mount encrypted OS X spare image files

## About

Sparse Image is an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for [OS X](https://www.apple.com/osx/) that allows you to easily mount an encrypted .sparseimage file. A sparse image is a type of disk image file used by Mac OS X that grows in size as the user adds data to the image, taking up only as much disk space as stored in it. Encrypted sparse image files are used to secure a user's home directory by the FileVault feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and earlier. Sparse images can be created using the [Disk Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image).

## System Requirements

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) and the Alfred [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)

## Basic Usage

Type `sparse` in Alfred followed by the password of the encrypted spare image that you define in the "Run Script" section of the workflow.
